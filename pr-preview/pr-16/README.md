# RTS Development Guidelines

A guide for promoting best practices among RTS code repositories.

## Introduction

The software industry is constantly evolving. Our own practices should similarly evolve to
disseminate knowledge throughout teams, share ownership, make it easier for newcomers to start and
for seasoned developers to contribute to any project.

## Guides

The following guides are offered to help you improve your repository:

- [Readme Guide](./guides/README_GUIDE.md): Write a great introductory text for your repository.
- [Contributing Guide](./guides/CONTRIBUTING_GUIDE.md): Ensure smooth collaboration and
  contribution to your project.
- [Code of Conduct Guide](./guides/CODE_OF_CONDUCT_GUIDE.md): Provide guidelines to ensure
  everyone can safely contribute.
- [License Guide](./guides/LICENSE_GUIDE.md): Pick an appropriate license.
- [Security Guide](./guides/SECURITY_GUIDE.md): Provide guidelines for optimizing the security of
  the repository and its content.

> [!TIP]
> GitHub Community Standards are a great source of information and best practices. You can check
> that your project follows these standards at any time by checking _Community Standards_ under the
_Insights_ section.
