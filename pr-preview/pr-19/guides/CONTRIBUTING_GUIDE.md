# Contributing Guide

Provide more context about contributions you are looking for and how they should occur.

> [!TIP]
> More information is available from [GitHub documentation][github-documentation].

## Writing Contributing guidelines

Writing Contributing guidelines depends on your project and how your team decides to process
contributions. To help you:

- The [Pillarbox Contributing guidelines][pillarbox-contributing] is an example describing which
  contributions are considered, how they should occur (with links to the corresponding templates)
  and how they will be processed.
- The following [template][contributing-template] can be used if you need to write Contributing
  guidelines tailored to your needs.

## Adding Contributing guidelines

Add a file called `CONTRIBUTING.md` to the root of your repository, the `docs` folder, or
the `.github` folder, with the text you wrote. GitHub automatically adds a link to this file in the
_About_ section of your repository homepage.

## Next steps

Now that you've added a Contributing Guide to your project, you can help contributors further with
a pull request template. Follow-up with our [Pull Request Manual][pr-guide].
