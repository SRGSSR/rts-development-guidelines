# [Platform] Development Kits and Libraries

This page outlines the recommended Development Kits and Libraries for [Platform] development. It
categorizes tools into **Must-Have**, **Should-Have**, based on necessity, and assesses their
utility to aid in selection. This guide ensures that all tools align with our companyâ€™s standards
and best practices.

## Overview

Below is a prioritization matrix that categorizes SDKs and libraries based on their utility and
necessity. This visual guide helps in quick decision-making regarding tool adoption.
