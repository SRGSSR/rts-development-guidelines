## Picking a Code of Conduct

The [Contributor Covenant][contributor-covenant] provides a great Code of Conduct. You can use it
as-is, adapt it to your needs, or write your own document.

## Adding a Code of Conduct

Add a file called `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to the root of your repository, the `docs` folder, or
the `.github` folder, with the text of the Code of Conduct you chose. GitHub automatically adds a
link to this file in the _About_ section of your repository homepage.
